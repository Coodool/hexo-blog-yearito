Good Afternoon. We are here on this special day to share with everyone the most important moment in their lives. They have learnt to know and to love each other, and now they have decided to live their lives together as husband and wife.

<!-- more -->


下午好，我们相聚于这特别的一天，共同分享他们生命中最重要的时刻。他们学会了解彼此，深爱彼此，并决定以夫妻的身份共度生命。


In Bali, the people say that the union of water and rice provides them with all they need for wealth, health and lift and, it is our hope that the union between Gao Zhenman and Ye Quan will be like the union of water and rice and bear in their lives much happiness.

在巴厘岛，人们常说“水和米的结合会带来财富、健康和生活的一切”，我们祝愿新郎新娘的结合就像巴厘岛的水和米一样，为他们的生活代来无比的幸福和快乐。

Real love between two people is perhaps the highest of all human emotions. Such love, above all, gives lift new purpose and meaning.

两人间的真爱可能是全人类最重要的情感，尤其是他们的这份爱，为他们的生命代来了新的目标和意义。

They believe this commitment brings a special kind of bond, and a deep sense of loving concern for each other at all times. It allows them to grow and develop both separately and together.

他们相信这份承诺将成为他们特殊的纽带，他们也会一直带着深爱关怀彼此。这将带给他们共同而又独立的成长与发展。

Gao Zhenman and Ye Quan have a relationship that is based on respect for each other as individuals, consideration of each other's wishes, admiration for each other's qualities, and a very firm desire that it will strengthen and deepen. They know that this commitment is far more than simply living together as lifelong partners.

新郎和新娘拥有的感情是基于对彼此独立个体的尊重，对彼此愿望的慎重考虑，对彼此品性的赞赏。他们坚信这份感情会愈加强大愈加深厚，他们明白这份承诺远不仅仅是简单地作为一生的伴侣生活在一起。

<br />

{% cq %} DECLARATION {% endcq %}

Now I will declare your commitment to one another.

现在，我将宣布你们对彼此的誓言。

Before you, Gao Zhenman and Ye Quan are joined together in my presence and in the presence of family and friends, I am bound as you know to remind you publicly of the solemn, the serious and binding nature of the relationship into which you are now about to enter. This commitment, as most of us understand it, is the voluntary and full commitment of two partners. It is made in the deepest sense to the exclusion of all others and is entered into with the desire, the hope and the firm intention that it will last for life.

在你们正式在我和众亲朋好友的见证下结为夫妻之前，我有义务提醒你们，你们即将步入的这段关系是庄严的，是严肃的，是有约束力的。这份誓言，众所周知，是伴侣之间自愿的、完全的承诺。它是你们排出一切外物后最深的情感迸发，是你们自愿带着心愿，带着希望，带着厮守一生的坚定愿望共同迈向新的阶段。

<br />

Therefore, I ask you Ye Quan, will you take Gao Zhenman to be your wife? Will you love and respect her, care for her and stand by her, so you can completely share your life together?

因此，新郎你愿意取新娘为妻吗？你会爱她、尊重她、关照她、支持她并与她完全分享你的一生吗？
